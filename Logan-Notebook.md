# Logan's Notebook

3/29/24
This is where I will document my work. The first thing I am doing is creating this notebook

The metric being used is fire incidents for my data set.
Looking at the 40 types of fire incidents, I had to assign a weight to each one.
Ex. A dump fire or a forest fire is more severe than a grass fire on its own

I have the weightings assigned for every type of fire incident listed and a dictionary of every neighborhood listed.
I have to add everything together, with my weighting being a large portion of the metric, and then visualize it.

The visualization I have today is completely incomprehensible, but I will make it aesthetic another day.
Today, I am happy to have a valid data set.
